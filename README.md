This is a Numerov 1D Schr√∂dinger equation solver, it can simulate transmission through arbitrary potential.

### Features

* Transmissions can be plotted.
* Wavefunctions can be also plotted, I attached two of these as well.
* The transmission is calclated from a system of linear equations, I added "n" index difference because first I thought I would get singular matrix from adjacent sampling points.


My results are attached in the folder.
